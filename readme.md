# Rebuilding Rails

Demo from book examples.

The project is proceeding in three stages:

1. read the book and punch all the code in "the hard way,"
that is, by hand.

2. a second pass to cover everything with tests.

3. a third pass to add rubydocs to everything.


2018-06-09: putting on hold for now with specs part of the way finished.
There are some other projects I'd like to work on instead. Will get back
to this in the future.
